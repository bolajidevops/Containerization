# Capstone Project - Containerization and Container Orchestration

## Phase 1: Basic Frontend Application with Docker and Kubernetes

#### i. Hypothetical use case

Developing a simple static website (HTML and CSS) for a company's landing page. The goal is to containerize this application using Docker, deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster, and access it through Nginx.

#### ii. Project setup

- A project directory is created (Containerization).

- Inside the directory an HTML and CSS file are created (index.html and styles.css)

#### iii. Git initialization

A git repository is initialize for my project directory, this keeps record of any changes in my project.

`git init`

#### iv. Git Commit

A git add and commit are done. This allow git to be aware of files in my folder so as to keep track of any changes been made on them and by commiting simply give description of any changes made.  

`git add .`

`git commit -m "first commit"`

#### v. Dockerizing the Application
